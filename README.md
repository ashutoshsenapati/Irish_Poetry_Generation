LSTMs
This is the result of running a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on a 26MB file of popular song lyrics. The training took about 30h on a GTX 960. Due to copyright restrictions, the input file is not provided, but you can download the trained weights to create some random "poetry".
